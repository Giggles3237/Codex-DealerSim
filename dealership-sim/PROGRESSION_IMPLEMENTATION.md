# Universal Paperclips-Style Progression Implementation

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

### Backend Core Systems

1. **Progression Types** (`shared/src/types.ts`)
   - `Upgrade` interface with requirements, effects, and purchase state
   - `Achievement` interface for milestone tracking
   - `UpgradeEffect` for defining what each upgrade unlocks
   - Added `availableUpgrades`, `purchasedUpgrades`, and `achievements` to `GameState`

2. **Unlock Definitions** (`backend/src/core/progression/unlockDefinitions.ts`)
   - 24 upgrades defined across 5 categories
   - Progression path from 1 advisor ‚Üí 8 advisors
   - Service department unlock at $50k revenue
   - Automation features (Auto-Pricer, Auto-Buyer, Marketing Optimizer)
   - Speed multiplier unlocks (5x and 30x)
   - Inventory expansions (15 ‚Üí 30 ‚Üí 60 ‚Üí 100 ‚Üí 200 slots)
   - 10 achievements for milestone tracking

3. **Unlock Manager** (`backend/src/core/progression/unlockManager.ts`)
   - `checkUpgradeRequirements()` - Validates if upgrade can be unlocked
   - `evaluateUpgrades()` - Finds newly unlocked upgrades each day
   - `evaluateAchievements()` - Tracks achievement completion
   - `purchaseUpgrade()` - Handles upgrade purchase and effect application
   - `runProgressionCheck()` - Main daily check for new unlocks

4. **Feature Flags** (`backend/src/core/progression/featureFlags.ts`)
   - `getMaxAdvisors()`, `getMaxTechnicians()`, `getMaxInventorySlots()`
   - `hasServiceAccess()` - Check if service department unlocked
   - `canAutoAdvance()`, `canAutoBuy()`, `canAutoPricer()`, `canOptimizeMarketing()`
   - `getMaxSpeed()` - Returns maximum speed multiplier available
   - `validateInventoryPurchase()` - Enforces slot limits and bulk buying
   - `validateHiring()` - Enforces staff limits

5. **Minimal Starting State** (`backend/src/data/seed.ts`)
   - Starting cash reduced: $150k ‚Üí $25k
   - Advisors reduced: 3 ‚Üí 1 (Rookie archetype with lower skills)
   - Technicians: 2 ‚Üí 0 (service locked)
   - Inventory: 8 mixed vehicles ‚Üí 4 cheap used cars ($16k-$23k)
   - Marketing budget: $500/day ‚Üí $200/day
   - New welcome messages explaining the minimal start
   - Achievements initialized on game start

6. **Engine Integration** (`backend/src/core/engine/loop.ts`)
   - `runProgressionCheck()` called daily in `runDailyOperations()`
   - Notifications added for new unlocks and achievements
   - Seamlessly integrated with existing game loop

## üîß What Still Needs Work

### Testing & Bug Fixes
1. Test full progression from start to automation
2. Verify all upgrade effects are actually applied
3. Check that feature flags prevent unauthorized actions
4. Test edge cases (buying when at limit, etc.)

### Balance Adjustments
1. May need to adjust unlock costs based on playtesting
2. Starting cash might be too tight or too generous
3. Service unlock timing might need tweaking
4. Speed unlock requirements may need adjustment

### UI Enhancements (Optional)
1. Add locked feature tooltips ("Unlock at $X revenue")
2. Show progression path/roadmap
3. Achievement notifications could be more prominent
4. Add unlock sound effects or animations
5. Dashboard could show "Next Unlock" hint

### Missing Features from Plan (Lower Priority)
1. Notification priority levels (currently all same)
2. Auto-pricer automation logic (upgrade exists but not implemented)
3. Auto-buyer automation logic (upgrade exists but not implemented)
4. Marketing optimizer automation logic (upgrade exists but not implemented)

## üöÄ How to Test

1. **Start Fresh Game**
   ```bash
   cd dealership-sim/backend
   npm run dev -- --reset
   ```

2. **Check Starting State**
   - Should have 1 advisor (Rookie)
   - 4 cheap used cars ($16k-$23k range)
   - $25,000 cash
   - No technicians
   - No upgrades available yet

3. **Sell Cars to Unlock First Upgrade**
   - Sell 3-5 cars to reach $15k revenue
   - Go to "üíé Upgrades" tab
   - Should see "Hire 2nd Sales Advisor" available
   - Purchase it if you have $5k cash

4. **Progress Through Game**
   - Keep selling, watch upgrades unlock
   - Try to purchase upgrades
   - Verify service tab appears after buying "Service Department"
   - Test speed controls after buying Sales Manager

5. **Test Limits**
   - Try to hire advisor when at limit (should fail)
   - Try to buy more inventory than slots (should fail)
   - Verify error messages are helpful

## üìù Key Design Decisions

1. **Hidden Until Unlocked** - Upgrades don't appear until requirements met, creating sense of discovery
2. **No Refunds** - Purchases are permanent, adds weight to decisions
3. **Cash-Based** - All upgrades cost cash, not separate currency (simpler)
4. **Progressive Automation** - Manual ‚Üí Semi-Auto ‚Üí Full Auto over hours of play
5. **Service as Major Unlock** - Service department is significant mid-game milestone
6. **Speed Tied to Progress** - Can't speed through early game, must earn it

## üéØ Success Metrics

The progression system works if:
- ‚úÖ Players feel rewarded every 5-10 minutes in early game
- ‚úÖ Each unlock feels meaningful and changes gameplay
- ‚úÖ Progression is clear and motivating
- ‚úÖ Late game becomes increasingly automated
- ‚úÖ Player can see path from tiny lot ‚Üí empire
- ‚úÖ Cash flow feels tight early, comfortable late
- ‚úÖ No dead ends or "stuck" states

## üêõ Known Issues

None yet - needs testing!
